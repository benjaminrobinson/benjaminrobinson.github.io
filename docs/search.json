As you can probably tell from the URL, my name is Benjamin Robinson (although some folks call me Ben, which is also fine by me). I’ve lived in some great cities all across the country including: Cincinnati, OH (hometown), Pittsburgh, PA (college), Los Angeles, CA (graduate school), and now in Washington D.C., where I’ve lived since 2014.\nCurrently, I am a Manager of Data Strategy & Insights at the Universal Service Administrative Company where my work focuses on managing the delivery of business intelligence and open data projects along with data science software and analytics product. However, there’s a decent chance that you might know me from my work on Grinding The Mocks, which is both a side project and a data/insights company I founded that uses mock drafts, the wisdom of crowds, and machine learning models to predict the NFL Draft. Through this work, I’ve been fortunate to work with NFL teams, agents, and football analytics companies as well as having my work featured in FiveThirtyEight, The New York Times, and Football Outsiders.\nBut there’s so much more to me than my work! In my personal life, I’m also passionate about:\n\nbeing Jewish (✡️and proud of it)\ntrying to be the best uncle to my niece and nephew (❤️you J&D)\ncollecting vinyl records (check out my Discogs💽)\nrooting for my favorite sports teams (especially the Cincinnati Reds ⚾, Liverpool Football Club ⚽, and PITT Panthers 🏈 & 🏀)!"

Stroud Falls to Colts in GTM’s Final Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\nDear Football Outsiders readers, I know that you are probably tired of mock drafts and don’t need yet another one. That’s OK! I feel your pain. On the other hand, I have collected over 2,000 mock drafts this cycle, so what’s one more? I won’t bore you too much longer with the particulars except to say: “For those about to mock, I SALUTE YOU!” \n\n\nApr 26, 2023\n\n\n\n\nIs C.J. Stroud a Candidate to Slide?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“NFL Draft - Risers and fallers. Stock up and stock down. It’s a tale as old as draft time immemorial. With the 2023 NFL draft season in the home stretch, let’s take a look at which players have the most momentum heading into draft week and which players are slipping and sliding down the Grinding the Mocks’ draft boards. Looking back at last year’s final list of Risers and Fallers is both a fun exercise and a humbling one at the same time. It’s a lesson in the cruel randomness and, as Donald Rumsfeld said, the”unknown unknowns” that make up the NFL draft.” \n\n\nApr 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\nColts Take Will Levis in Latest Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Previously on the NFL Draft: In 2022, we witnessed an unforgettable event as Trevor Lawrence was selected as the first overall pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars. The draft also saw a flurry of trades, with teams jostling for position to secure their preferred prospects. But as always, the draft is full of surprises. Will any teams make unexpected trades? Which under-the-radar prospects will emerge as future stars? And who will be the lucky team to select the next generational talent? Find out now on the 2023 NFL Draft.”\n\n\n\nApr 11, 2023\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Richardson Highlights Post-Combine Risers\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“If Travon Walker was the clear-cut winner of the 2022 NFL combine, then 2023’s winner must be Florida’s Anthony Richardson. Both are winners for similar reasons. As players without high levels of college production, it was well known that athleticism would be each player’s calling card. However, what we witnessed from both Richardson and Walker went above and beyond expectations and made them both post-combine contenders for top overall pick honors. Richardson put up the best ever performance by a quarterback at the NFL combine. His speed, size, and explosion offer a glimpse into the type of talent he can show if he can develop as a player.” \n\n\nMar 16, 2023\n\n\n\n\nAnderson Graduates to Bears in GTM Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Welcome to draft season! Unless you’re a Miami Dolphins fan. Or a 49ers, Broncos, Rams, Texans, or Browns fan. If so, congratulations on your tampering/acquisitions, but your first night of the draft will likely be less interesting than the rest of the league’s. For the rest of you, here’s an early look at the rookies you might be cheering for this fall.” \n\n\nFeb 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\nWhen Draft Pundits Are Right, and N.F.L. Teams Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\nNate Cohn\n\n\n““Betting against the N.F.L.’s overall assessment of players is essentially saying your evaluation of a player is better than everyone else,” said Benjamin Robinson, the founder of Grinding the Mocks, a site that analyzes the draft. “It’s not sustainable.”“ \n\n\nApr 28, 2022\n\n\n\n\nBulldogs, Ebiketie Surprise in Final GTM 2022 Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“We made it, everyone! It’s officially NFL draft week. No sleep till Vegas! I really hope that the festivities go down as originally planned for 2020: the prospects traveling to the stage via a boat that takes them across the Bellagio fountains. I don’t have much else to say, except”may the NFL draft odds ever be in my favor here and in The Huddle Report Mock Draft Contest.” Ideally, I would love to have published this after the mocks by the most accurate draftniks in the industry have been released but such is the way of the world!“ \n\n\nApr 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\nWill Desmond Ridder Go in the First Round?\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Kyle Hamilton is probably the king of the aforementioned”overthinking season.” Hamilton played like a top-10 player during the 2021 college football season, then had a not-amazing combine followed by a fine pro day. Normally, that would be a perfect recipe for some positive regression to the top-10 status that Hamilton earned entering the draft process. But that’s not happening. Why? It might be the opposite of the “Christian Kirk” effect that I mentioned earlier about high-end wide receivers. It all comes down to the positional value that teams have assigned to safeties in the free-agent market.” \n\n\nApr 19, 2022\n\n\n\n\nHutchinson Goes First in Latest GTM Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Free agency has come and gone and changed the landscape of the NFL as teams head into 100% draft mode over the coming month. Never in the recent history of the league has there been such a disdain for first-round draft picks as the Denver Broncos (Russell Wilson), Cleveland Browns (Deshaun Watson), Las Vegas Raiders (Davante Adams), and Miami Dolphins (Tyreek Hill) joined the Chicago Bears (Justin Fields), San Francisco 49ers (Trey Lance), Indianapolis Colts (Carson Wentz), and Los Angeles Rams (Matthew Stafford) as teams without high-profile draft selections in 2022.” \n\n\nMar 29, 2022\n\n\n\n\nTravon Walker Highlights Post-Combine Risers\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Travon Walker is 100% the biggest winner from this year’s combine. Walker played on a stacked National Championship-winning Georgia defense that will likely have at least eight players drafted this year alone, with four of the eight included in the Grinding the Mocks’ Post-Combine/Pre-Free Agency Top 32. Walker was viewed as the sixth-ranked edge rusher and 22nd-ranked player in the draft class pre-combine; two weeks after, he has risen to be the third-ranked edge rusher and sixth-ranked player.” \n\n\nMar 18, 2022\n\n\n\n\nGTM Mock Draft: Jaguars Go Offensive Line\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“For fans of the Rams and Bengals, welcome to draft season. Actually, that welcome really only applies to Bengals fans—the Rams don’t have a first-round pick this year or next thanks to the aforementioned Matthew Stafford trade, and they don’t have a pick at all in this draft until the supplemental draft selections at the end of the third round (which they received due to the Lions hiring current general manager Brad Holmes). Good times!” \n\n\nFeb 15, 2022\n\n\n\n\nFinal 2021 Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“We made it, everyone! It’s officially NFL draft week (or the week before the draft since that’s when I’m technically writing this article). Through the twists and turns of a college football season that almost didn’t happen to not having a combine, this has been another unprecedented draft process. I don’t have much else to say, except: may the NFL draft odds ever be in my favor here and in The Huddle Report Mock Draft Contest.” \n\n\nApr 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\nPre-Free Agency Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Well, it turns out that while I may know how to write R code to scrape mock drafts and run statistical models, writing an accurate mock draft is much easier said than done. Out of the 269 first-round mock drafts that were published within two weeks of the draft in 2020, my Grinding the Mocks’ Meta-Mock Draft projections had a pick-adjusted mean squared error around the 50th percentile (it probably didn’t help that I listed six players as first-round picks that ended up as second-round picks, including a pretty late second-rounder) and even two players who ended up being drafted in the third round.” \n\n\nMar 15, 2021\n\n\n\n\nGrinding the Mocks’ Meta-Mock Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Isn’t it ironic? As someone who collects mock drafts and aggregates them for my Grinding the Mocks project, I have never done my own mock draft. Don’t get me wrong, I have spent many a lunch break sitting in front of (insert favorite mock draft simulator here). In the lead up to the 2019 NFL draft, I posted my top 32 ranked players by Expected Draft Position (EDP), but this year I will attempt to get down in the weeds a little bit with all the tape-grinders out there.” \n\n\nApr 21, 2020\n\n\n\n\nThe Value of Mock Drafts\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Robinson\n\n\n“Over the years, mock drafts have been derided as unrealistic at best and meaningless at worst by fans and the media, but I could think of no other source of data that could adequately answer what I was trying to get at that first night of the 2018 draft. So I did what any analytically minded person does when they don’t have data: I collected it myself.” \n\n\nApr 7, 2020\n\n\n\n\nWe Looked At Almost 2,000 Mock NFL Drafts. Here’s What We Learned.\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Hermsmeyer\n\n\n“Using data from Benjamin Robinson, who has curated close to 2,000 mock drafts from expert, media and fan sources from April 2018 to present, here are some of the most interesting fluctuations over the past few months — along with some of our own analysis mixed in. After all, it’s the draft, so we are all experts.” \n\n\nApr 25, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Appetizers\nLet’s dig into the data, first at a macro level and then at a micro level focusing on Texas QB Quinn Ewers, who just declared for the NFL draft today and had probably one of the most difficult declaration decisions to make in the entire draft class.  Here is how draft outcomes shook out for all the prospects with a large enough sample size of mock drafts/big boards to be eligible for an Expected Draft Position (aka EDP), 10 different mocks from 10 different draftniks, at this point in the draft cycle from 2019 to 2024 with the range of draft outcomes grouped as:\n\nRiser - Drafted a Round or more earlier than their EDP Rank’s Round\nFaller - Drafted a Round or more later than their EDP Rank’s Round\nSteady - Drafted in the same Round as their EDP Rank’s Round\n\n\nExcluding prospects who decided to return to school (recognizing the selection bias of those players, who make up about 20% of the players in the sample), the average prospects’ draft stock is off by only about one round on average (assuming that Undrafted Players are all drafted in “Round 8”) or by about 40 picks up or down.  The plurality of players (about 45%) is grouped as a “Faller”, which makes sense since there is a lot more room to fall in the draft than there is to rise, and on average those players’ draft stock drops by about 2 rounds of draft capital by the time of the draft.  The next largest group of prospects is in the “Steady” bucket, which makes up about 33% of the prospect pool and represents those whose stock is fairly static, with those players only moving up or down by about 10 picks from their current EDP.  The smallest group of the bunch is the “Riser” group, which makes up about 20% of prospects, with those players’ draft stock growing by about a round and a half by the draft.\n\nPer the chart above, in a perfect world we’d like to have our solid blue line as close to the black dotted line as possible and at this point in the draft cycle we are overprojecting players by about a round on average as we showed in that first table and we can see the stronger accuracy in the early rounds but the difference seems to be somewhat consistent across the years of data at this point in time through the past 6 draft classes.\n\nBelow the surface, it’s exciting to see that the positions that fell below the MAE of players with enough sample size to be Grinding the Mocks EDP-eligible at this point in the draft process are: QB, the premium positions of EDGE and OT, the offensive skill positions outside of TE (RB, and WR), and DT, a position of rising prominence and importance across the NFL."

    "text": "Main Course\nNow, let’s return our focus to our hero, Texas’s Quinn Ewers, who announced today his intention to enter the 2025 NFL Draft. As a recruit, Ewers was the highest-rated player in his high school class by the 247Sports Composite Rankings and signed with Ohio State. Unfortunately for him, current Houston Texans QB C.J. Stroud was blocking his path to playing time so he transferred to Texas where he has been the starter for the larger part of three seasons and led the Longhorns to the College Football Playoff in back-to-back years.\n\nNow let’s dig into Grinding the Mocks data for Quinn Ewers and what it says about his draft stock currently and his future. Looking at his Draft Stock Chart below, we can see that Ewers came into the 2024 season with a lot of hype and a first-round EDP ranking. However, he didn’t truly live up to those high expectations. According to ESPN’s Total QBR, he went from a very respectable 78.7 (ranked 15th) in 2024 to a disappointing 71.3 (ranked 33rd) in 2023.\nWe can also observe from Grinding the Mocks data that Ewers’ EDP peaked in early October and has been falling ever since. Knowing what we know about Ewers’ draft stock we would probably advise Ewers that his EDP is likely to continue to fall as the draft approaches just based on trends alone. But we’re data people and we need more than just a single chart to make an inference about Ewers’ draft stock. What we need is…another model?"

    "text": "Dessert\nEnter a new model (a Bayesian model to boot!) which instead of predicting draft position for players is focused on predicting the round a player is selected since picking what round a player is more appropriate at this point in the draft process than what pick. This model is structured similarly to our advanced Grinding the Mocks Draft Probability model with random effects on mock draft rounds and grouped by position and conference. That model projects that based on Ewer’s positioning mock drafts that he is likely to be between a 3rd and 4th Round selection in the upcoming draft. This is a nice “back-of-the-computer” model that gives us an estimate that is somewhat reflective of our numbers from earlier that we can expect QBs to get drafted about a round later than where their current EDP round projects them based on historic trends.\n\nBecause this model is “Bayesian”, it reflects more of the uncertainty surrounding the draft, which we ideally want in a methodology to apply to answer the question we have. However, it also can produce “confusing” results such as a 10% probability of Quinn Ewers getting selected in Round 1. That is because the Bayesian model likes to spread probabilities around across the distribution despite the idea that we would like it to have stronger opinions about players in earlier rounds than later ones. This is not necessarily a bad thing!"

    "text": "Digestif\nNow that Ewers has entered the draft, we can say that he has likely taken into account that his draft stock has fallen relative to where it was at the beginning of the season and is somewhat comfortable with the risk. Looking back in hindsight, Ewers may have been better served by entering the 2024 NFL Draft (he may have had a case to be drafted as the QB7 given that Spencer Rattler went in Round 5) but it was a risk that he obviously was willing to take.\n\nEwers was rumored to be considering a multi-million dollar NIL deal to transfer to another school, which his fellow draft prospect Carson Beck is believed to have taken to leave Georgia and attend Miami. Whether that number is true (likely not), the allure of the NFL is strong and will give Ewers a new opportunity to show that he really is as good as people thought coming into the 2024 season and going back to his days as a recruit. On the other hand, it’s also fairly likely that like many prospects before him who have flashed potential in college, Ewers may struggle as a pro. Unlike his time at Texas, the NFL team that drafts him will have much less of a talent and schematic advantage than he enjoyed at Texas. As the author who inspired the title of this piece once write: “all the world’s a stage.”, right?"
