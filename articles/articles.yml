    *Dear Football Outsiders readers,
    I know that you are probably tired of mock drafts and don't need yet another one. That's OK! I feel your pain. On the other hand, I have collected over 2,000 mock drafts this cycle, so what's one more? I won't bore you too much longer with the particulars except to say: "For those about to mock, I SALUTE YOU!"*

    *"NFL Draft - Risers and fallers. Stock up and stock down. It's a tale as old as draft time immemorial. With the 2023 NFL draft season in the home stretch, let's take a look at which players have the most momentum heading into draft week and which players are slipping and sliding down the Grinding the Mocks' draft boards. Looking back at last year's final list of Risers and Fallers is both a fun exercise and a humbling one at the same time. It's a lesson in the cruel randomness and, as Donald Rumsfeld said, the "unknown unknowns" that make up the NFL draft."*

    *"Previously on the NFL Draft: In 2022, we witnessed an unforgettable event as Trevor Lawrence was selected as the first overall pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars. The draft also saw a flurry of trades, with teams jostling for position to secure their preferred prospects.
    But as always, the draft is full of surprises. Will any teams make unexpected trades? Which under-the-radar prospects will emerge as future stars? And who will be the lucky team to select the next generational talent? Find out now on the 2023 NFL Draft."*

    *"If Travon Walker was the clear-cut winner of the 2022 NFL combine, then 2023's winner must be Florida's Anthony Richardson. Both are winners for similar reasons. As players without high levels of college production, it was well known that athleticism would be each player's calling card. However, what we witnessed from both Richardson and Walker went above and beyond expectations and made them both post-combine contenders for top overall pick honors. Richardson put up the best ever performance by a quarterback at the NFL combine. His speed, size, and explosion offer a glimpse into the type of talent he can show if he can develop as a player."*

If so, congratulations on your tampering/acquisitions, but your first night of the draft will likely be less interesting than the rest of the league's. For the rest of you, here's an early look at the rookies you might be cheering for this fall."*

I really hope that the festivities go down as originally planned for 2020: the prospects traveling to the stage via a boat that takes them across the Bellagio fountains. I don't have much else to say, except "may the NFL draft odds ever be in my favor here and in The Huddle Report Mock Draft Contest." Ideally, I would love to have published this after the mocks by the most accurate draftniks in the industry have been released but such is the way of the world!"*

    *"Kyle Hamilton is probably the king of the aforementioned "overthinking season." Hamilton played like a top-10 player during the 2021 college football season, then had a not-amazing combine followed by a fine pro day. Normally, that would be a perfect recipe for some positive regression to the top-10 status that Hamilton earned entering the draft process. But that's not happening. Why? It might be the opposite of the "Christian Kirk" effect that I mentioned earlier about high-end wide receivers. It all comes down to the positional value that teams have assigned to safeties in the free-agent market."*

    *"Travon Walker is 100% the biggest winner from this year's combine. Walker played on a stacked National Championship-winning Georgia defense that will likely have at least eight players drafted this year alone, with four of the eight included in the Grinding the Mocks' Post-Combine/Pre-Free Agency Top 32. Walker was viewed as the sixth-ranked edge rusher and 22nd-ranked player in the draft class pre-combine; two weeks after, he has risen to be the third-ranked edge rusher and sixth-ranked player."*

Actually, that welcome really only applies to Bengals fans—the Rams don't have a first-round pick this year or next thanks to the aforementioned Matthew Stafford trade, and they don't have a pick at all in this draft until the supplemental draft selections at the end of the third round (which they received due to the Lions hiring current general manager Brad Holmes). Good times!"*

Out of the 269 first-round mock drafts that were published within two weeks of the draft in 2020, my Grinding the Mocks' Meta-Mock Draft projections had a pick-adjusted mean squared error around the 50th percentile (it probably didn't help that I listed six players as first-round picks that ended up as second-round picks, including a pretty late second-rounder) and even two players who ended up being drafted in the third round."*

In the lead up to the 2019 NFL draft, I posted my top 32 ranked players by Expected Draft Position (EDP), but this year I will attempt to get down in the weeds a little bit with all the tape-grinders out there."*
